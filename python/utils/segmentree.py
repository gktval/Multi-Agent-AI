#
# The proportianl prioritization variant uses a SumTree (the code below) to ...
# do efficient inserts, updates and samples. However, it seems that for min ...
# computation (to get max importance sampling weight wi) we need to access ...
# the min priority efficiently. One way could be to have an extra variable ...
# to hold the min and update it as new experiences, or updates in priority ...
# occur. Another approach is to use a separate structure (mintree) to allow ...
# O(log n  +  k) access to the min, which is the approach taken here.
